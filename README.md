# spock-rock-game
A developed rock paper scissors game by adding two more icons as "Lizard" and "Spock". This was inspired from Big Bang Theory series. See the [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5Q6-wMx-K8).


## How to play  
In order to play we need to know the following rulls:    
* Scissors cuts Paper
* Paper covers Rock
* Rock crushes Lizard
* Lizard poisons Spock
* Spock mashes Scissors
* Scissors decapitate Lizard
* Lizard eats Paper
* Paper disproves Spock
* Spock vaporizes Rock
* Rock crushes scissors

    
  Many rulles to remember? No worries, they are all coded in the game and all you need to do is playing it!
  ## What techs are used
  Vanilla JavaScript is a perfect program when it comes to write a game with a complicated logic and interactive UI elements.
  For showing the confetti effect after player's win, I used the CSSscript file that you can check it [here](https://www.cssscript.com/confetti-falling-animation/).

  ## Future improvemetns
  At this moment there is no adding up scores for each player, it means there is only one round for win or lose. I am planing to add a 5 round of the game so each player would lose or win with higher score at the end of the 5th round.
